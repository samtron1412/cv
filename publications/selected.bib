  abstract={
    Recent work has shown how to embed differentiable optimization problems (that is, problems whose solutions can be backpropagated through) as layers within deep learning architectures. This method provides a useful inductive bias for certain problems, but existing software for differentiable optimization layers is rigid and difficult to apply to new settings. In this paper, we propose an approach to differentiating through disciplined convex programs, a subclass of convex optimization problems used by domain-specific languages (DSLs) for convex optimization. We introduce disciplined parametrized programming, a subset of disciplined convex programming, and we show that every disciplined parametrized program can be represented as the composition of an affine map from parameters to problem data, a solver, and an affine map from the solver’s solution to a solution of the original problem (a new form we refer to as affine-solver-affine form). We then demonstrate how to efficiently differentiate through each of these components, allowing for end-to-end analytical differentiation through the entire convex program. We implement our methodology in version 1.1 of CVXPY, a popular Python-embedded DSL for convex optimization, and additionally implement differentiable layers for disciplined convex programs in PyTorch and TensorFlow 2.0. Our implementation significantly lowers the barrier to using convex optimization problems in differentiable programs. We present applications in linear machine learning models and in stochastic control, and we show that our layer is competitive (in execution time) compared to specialized differentiable solvers from past work.

  abstract={
    We study the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) for the non-convex
    optimization of a continuous and parameterized
    objective function and introduce a differentiable
    variant (DCEM) that enables us to differentiate the
    output of CEM with respect to the objective
    function's parameters. In the machine learning
    setting this brings CEM inside of the end-to-end
    learning pipeline where this has otherwise been
    impossible. We show applications in a synthetic
    energy-based structured prediction task and in
    non-convex continuous control. In the control
    setting we show on the simulated cheetah and walker
    tasks that we can embed their optimal action
    sequences with DCEM and then use policy optimization
    to fine-tune components of the controller as a step
    towards combining model-based and model-free RL.

  abstract={
    We propose the Limited Multi-Label (LML) projection layer as a new
    primitive operation for end-to-end learning systems. The LML layer
    provides a probabilistic way of modeling multi-label predictions
    limited to having exactly k labels. We derive efficient forward and
    backward passes for this layer and show how the layer can be used to
    optimize the top-k recall for multi-label tasks with incomplete label
    information. We evaluate LML layers on top-k CIFAR-100 classification
    and scene graph generation. We show that LML layers add a negligible
    amount of computational overhead, strictly improve the model's
    representational capacity, and improve accuracy. We also revisit the
    truncated top-k entropy method as a competitive baseline for top-k
    classification.

  abstract={
We present foundations for using Model Predictive Control (MPC) as a differentiable policy class for reinforcement learning in continuous state and action spaces. This provides one way of leveraging and combining the advantages of model-free and model-based approaches. Specifically, we differentiate through MPC by using the KKT conditions of the convex approximation at a fixed point of the controller. Using this strategy, we are able to learn the cost and dynamics of a controller via end-to-end learning. Our experiments focus on imitation learning in the pendulum and cartpole domains, where we learn the cost and dynamics terms of an MPC policy class. We show that our MPC policies are significantly more data-efficient than a generic neural network and that our method is superior to traditional system identification in a setting where the expert is unrealizable.

  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08195},
  abstract={
A fundamental challenge in imperfect-information games is that states do not have well-defined values. As a result, depth-limited search algorithms used in single-agent settings and perfect-information games do not apply. This paper introduces a principled way to conduct depth-limited solving in imperfect-information games by allowing the opponent to choose among a number of strategies for the remainder of the game at the depth limit. Each one of these strategies results in a different set of values for leaf nodes. This forces an agent to be robust to the different strategies an opponent may employ. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by building a master-level heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em poker AI that defeats two prior top agents using only a 4-core CPU and 16 GB of memory. Developing such a powerful agent would have previously required a supercomputer.

    We consider the setting of an agent with a fixed body interacting with an
    unknown and uncertain external world. We show that models
    trained to predict proprioceptive information about the
    agent's body come to represent objects in the external world.
    In spite of being trained with only internally available
    signals, these dynamic body models come to represent external
    objects through the necessity of predicting their effects on
    the agent's own body. That is, the model learns holistic
    persistent representations of objects in the world, even
    though the only training signals are body signals. Our
    dynamics model is able to successfully predict distributions
    over 132 sensor readings over 100 steps into the future and we
    demonstrate that even when the body is no longer in contact
    with an object, the latent variables of the dynamics model
    continue to represent its shape. We show that active data
    collection by maximizing the entropy of predictions about the
    body---touch sensors, proprioception and vestibular
    information---leads to learning of dynamic models that show
    superior performance when used for control. We also collect
    data from a real robotic hand and show that the same models
    can be used to answer questions about properties of objects in
    the real world. Videos with qualitative results of our models

  abstract={
    As machine learning techniques have become more ubiquitous, it has
    become common to see machine learning prediction algorithms operating
    within some larger process. However, the criteria by which we train
    machine learning algorithms often differ from the ultimate criteria on
    which we evaluate them. This paper proposes an end-to-end approach for
    learning probabilistic machine learning models within the context of
    stochastic programming, in a manner that directly captures the
    ultimate task-based objective for which they will be used. We then
    present two experimental evaluations of the proposed approach, one as
    applied to a generic inventory stock problem and the second to a
    real-world electrical grid scheduling task. In both cases, we show
    that the proposed approach can outperform both a traditional modeling
    approach and a purely black-box policy optimization approach.

  abstract={
    This paper presents OptNet, a network architecture that integrates
    optimization problems (here, specifically in the form of quadratic programs)
    as individual layers in larger end-to-end trainable deep networks.
    These layers encode constraints and complex dependencies
    between the hidden states that traditional convolutional and
    fully-connected layers often cannot capture.
    In this paper, we explore the foundations for such an architecture:
    we show how techniques from sensitivity analysis, bilevel
    optimization, and implicit differentiation can be used to
    exactly differentiate through these layers and with respect
    to layer parameters;
    we develop a highly efficient solver for these layers that exploits fast
    GPU-based batch solves within a primal-dual interior point method, and which
    provides backpropagation gradients with virtually no additional cost on top of
    the solve;
    and we highlight the application of these approaches in several problems.
    In one notable example, we show that the method is
    capable of learning to play mini-Sudoku (4x4) given just input and output games,
    with no a priori information about the rules of the game;
    this highlights the ability of our architecture to learn hard
    constraints better than other neural architectures.

    This paper presents the input convex neural network
    architecture. These are scalar-valued (potentially deep) neural
    networks with constraints on the network parameters such that the
    output of the network is a convex function of (some of) the inputs.
    The networks allow for efficient inference via optimization over some
    inputs to the network given others, and can be applied to settings
    including structured prediction, data imputation, reinforcement
    learning, and others. In this paper we lay the basic groundwork for
    these models, proposing methods for inference, optimization and
    learning, and analyze their representational power. We show that many
    existing neural network architectures can be made input-convex with
    a minor modification, and develop specialized optimization
    algorithms tailored to this setting. Finally, we highlight the
    performance of the methods on multi-label prediction, image
    completion, and reinforcement learning problems, where we show
    improvement over the existing state of the art in many cases.

  abstract={
    Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) are probabilistic inference machines that admit
    exact inference in linear time in the size of the network. Existing
    parameter learning approaches for SPNs are largely based on the maximum
    likelihood principle and hence are subject to overfitting compared to
    more Bayesian approaches. Exact Bayesian posterior inference for SPNs is
    computationally intractable. Both standard variational inference and
    posterior sampling for SPNs are computationally infeasible even for
    networks of moderate size due to the large number of local latent
    variables per instance. In this work, we propose a novel deterministic
    collapsed variational inference algorithm for SPNs that is
    computationally efficient, easy to implement and at the same time allows
    us to incorporate prior information into the optimization formulation.
    Extensive experiments show a significant improvement in accuracy compared
    with a maximum likelihood based approach.

    Cameras are becoming ubiquitous in the Internet of Things (IoT) and

    QNSTOP consists of serial and parallel (OpenMP) Fortran 2003 codes for the
