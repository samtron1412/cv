about: '
  I am an undergraduate (senior) at <b>UC Berkeley</b>. I am interested
  in robotics, optimization problems, and applications in machine
  learning, including reinforcement learning and computer vision.
  <br><br>

  I am teaching two [EE16B](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee16b/sp20/)
  (Designing Information Devices and Systems II) discussion sections
  this semester. I will post my discussion slides and other resources
  for the course on this site, and you can access it through [this
  link](teaching/16b-sp20/).
