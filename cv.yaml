about: '
  I am a research scientist at <b>Facebook AI (FAIR)</b> in NYC and
  broadly study foundational topics and applications in
  <b>machine learning</b> (sometimes deep) and
  <b>optimization</b> (sometimes convex),
  including
  reinforcement learning, computer vision, language,
  statistics, and theory.
  I have a Ph.D. from <b>Carnegie Mellon University</b> and was
  advised by \href{http://zicokolter.com/}{Zico Kolter}
  and supported by an <b>NSF graduate research fellowship.</b>
  My thesis is on
  \href{https://github.com/bamos/thesis}{Differentiable Optimization-Based Modeling for Machine Learning}.
  My publications are available below and on
  \href{https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=d8gdZR4AAAAJ}{my Google Scholar page}
  and my open source contributions can be found on
  \href{https://github.com/bamos}{my Github profile}.
  I have also worked on <b>reinforcement learning</b>
  during an internship with
  \href{https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~nando/}{Nando de Freitas}
  and
  \href{http://mdenil.com/}{Misha Denil}
